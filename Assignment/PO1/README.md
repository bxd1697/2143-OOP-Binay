## P01 - Fraction Class
### Binay Devkota
### Description:

// This program does the fractional operations like multiplication, addition, substraction and division of any two given fractional numbers. It take input file containing data(i.e. fractions) .Fraction is given in the form of numerator/denominator. The data in the input file is given in the form fraction1(f1)<<oprator>>fraction2(f2).This programs runs the operations to give the final simplified version of answer in the form of fraction.

### Files

|   #   | File                           |         Description                                                          |
| :---: | ------------------------------ | -----------------------------------------------------------------------      |
|   1   | [fraction.cpp] fractions.cpp   | Main program that performs the fractional operations.                        |
|   2   | [fraction.h]fraction.h         | Class definition file                                                        |
|   3   | [fraction.txt]fractions.txt    | this is the input that file contains data on which operations are done       |

### Instructions

- This code requires a input .txt file names as fractions.txt to run fractional operations.
- Input file should have the data in a format such as "f1(n/d) operator f2(n/d).
  


- Example Command:
    - to compile use "g++ sourcefilename.cpp "

    - to run use "./a.out"
